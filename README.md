This page is a LIVE preliminary page in the kokomos repo outlining top-level 'patterns' for developing base_ and _service subdirectory files. It will update live and will be moved to another docs page on Github. It is here just to display some level of how we're considering modular, integrated development.
This and [node_services_x.py](https://github.com/thecommonsai/kokomos/blob/main/services/node_services_ex.py) are representatives of an abstract slice of what kokomos will be doing.


# Owl Preliminary Design Patterns

## 1. Modular Design Pattern
**Description:** Break down the system into distinct modules (_service, base_, facets, gems) that can be developed, tested, and debugged independently but work together seamlessly.

**Application:** Implement `node_service.py` and `edge_service.py` to handle business logic, while `base_nodes.py` and `base_edge.py` define foundational structures. Facets and gems act as specialized modules that extend the base functionalities.

## 2. Factory Pattern
**Description:** Use factory methods to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is crucial for creating nodes and edges dynamically based on user input or system requirements.

**Application:** Utilize factory classes in `base_nodes.py` and potentially `base_edge.py` to instantiate nodes and edges dynamically, ensuring `node_service.py` and `edge_service.py` can adapt to various node and edge types without direct dependency on their concrete implementations.

## 3. Observer Pattern
**Description:** Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Application:** Implement event-driven mechanisms in `node_service.py` and `edge_service.py` that allow for real-time updates to user interfaces or other system components when nodes or edges are added, updated, or deleted.

## 4. Strategy Pattern
**Description:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

**Application:** Use different strategies for handling user interactions, data validation, and graph traversal in nodes and edges, allowing for flexible switching between algorithms based on context (e.g., different validation rules for different node types).

## 5. Decorator Pattern
**Description:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Application:** Dynamically add features or information to nodes and edges, such as tagging, annotations, or metadata, without altering the underlying classes. This is particularly useful for facets and gems, where additional context or relationships might be added based on user actions or system analysis.

## 6. State Pattern
**Description:** Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

**Application:** Manage the state of nodes and edges, especially in handling the lifecycle of gems (e.g., from creation to validation to association with other nodes or facets). This pattern helps in tracking and responding to changes in the system's state space.

## 7. Graph Pattern
**Description:** Utilize graph data structures and algorithms to efficiently store, query, and manipulate relationships between entities.

**Application:** Leverage Neo4j and Neomodel for representing and querying nodes, edges, facets, and gems. Implement graph algorithms for recommendations, discovery, and analysis, ensuring the system can handle complex queries and relationships.

## 8. Singleton Pattern
**Description:** Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

**Application:** Use for managing database connections or central configuration settings, ensuring that resources are efficiently used and easily accessible throughout the system.

## 9. Command Pattern
**Description:** Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Application:** Implement command objects for user actions (e.g., create node, link nodes, update gem) that can be executed, undone, or logged, providing a flexible and extensible framework for user interactions.

By adopting these 'Owl Patterns', the development of the Owl system can be guided by a coherent set of principles that promote flexibility, scalability, and user engagement. These patterns form a methodology that not only addresses current system requirements but also anticipates future expansion and adaptation.
